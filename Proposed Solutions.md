# Proposed Solutions

## Solution 1:

Moving the Referral Details section from Program object to Location object.

This will enable the CAS team to add a new location record to a pre-existing program record with the corresponding referral information instead of having to create an entirely additional Program record.

## Solution 2:

Creating a new “Referral” object to store Referral data which can be linked to the Program object.
